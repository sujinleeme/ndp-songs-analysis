Ive seen the neon signs on old Broadway
Ive climbed the Eiffel Tower
The Great Wall in one hour
Experienced sweet and sour but thats okay

Seen Hollywood the sunsets in LA
The London Bridge Big Ben The Thames UK
Ive crossed the River Kwai
Yet still I dont know why
I think of you each night and every day

Theres no place Id rather be
Youll always be a part of me
And even though Ive roamed the world
Its still my home I long to see

This is where my family
And my friends grew up with me
So Ill cross the skies and sail the seas
To be where I wanna be

And turn it from a place
To a home that greets you

Remember the days, we set out together with faith?
Remember the times, so fine, when we thought that
Nothing could stand in our way?

Then things weren't the same, the life that we knew had to change
We've struggled through, the darkest storms
We thought we couldn't tame

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Through many years gone by, we've moved ahead together
We've built a brave new world where we could shine and grow
And now we only have to look towards tomorrow
To carry on the dream as far as it will go

So now we look around us and we see
A nation built with love by you and me
A land to treasure right down to the core
Our home, our heart, our Singapore
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

To my people of the future
We built it for the ones that dream
Hand in hand we make our land
Our home, the place to be
From young to Gold, our stories unfold,
Moments like these will speak
Words that last forever, worlds that come together
To show that we're all the same
We'll break the chains, to make a change
Burn bright, our lion city flame

And amazing as it seems
It all started with a dream
But the dreaming isn't done
Because the best is yet to come

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Deep in my heart I just know
Right from the start, we will grow
Look where we are, we've come so far
And there's still a long, long way to go
With all of my heart, I will care
I'll play my part, I will share
With family and friends, together we'll stand
And in the end, hand in hand
We will get there

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Our home, our heart, our dream.
