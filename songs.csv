 Guiding me closer to home
 To a place where I'll be safe and warm, where I belong
 
 Friends and families by my side
 Seeing me through as I grow and learn
 Every day's experience, bitter sweet or sour
 They're still wonderful
 As they become precious memories
 They'll be kept close to my heart
 And no matter where I am I will always know, where I belong
 
 Where I belong, where I keep my heart and soul
 Where dreams come true for us
 Where we walk together hand in hand towards a future so bright
 Where I belong, where I keep my heart and soul
 Where we're one big family

 Remember the times, so fine, when we thought that
 Nothing could stand in our way?
 
 Then things weren't the same
 The life that we knew had to change
 We've struggled through, the darkest storms
 We thought we couldn't tame
 
 Together we've tried, as we stood side by side
 I knew we'd build a new world
 A world of hope for ever after
 
 Deep in my heart I just know
 Right from the start, we will grow
 Look where we are, we've come so far
 And there's still a long, long way to go
 
 With all of my heart, I will care
 I'll play my part, I will share
 With family and friends, together we'll stand
 And in the end, hand in hand
 We will get there
 
 So now we begin, working together to win
 Believing in trust, it must
 Be possible to overcome anything
 
 There's so much to do, there's so much we can contribute
 By sharing just a little love
 We will start again anew
 
 So why don't we try? If we stand side by side
 I know we'll build a new world
 A world of hope for ever after"

2007,There’s No Place I’d Rather Be,Jimmy Ye,Jimmy Ye,Kit Chan,"I've walked the streets of Cairo and Bombay
 I've seen the neon signs on old Broadway
 I've climbed the Eiffel Tower
 The Great Wall in one hour
 Experienced sweet and sour but that's okay
 
 Seen Hollywood, the sunsets in LA
 The London Bridge, Big Ben, The Thames, UK
 I've crossed the River Kwai
 Yet still I don't know why
 I think of you each night and every day
 
 There's no place I'd rather be
 You'll always be a part of me
 And even though I've roamed the world
 It's still my home I long to see
 
 This is where my family
 And my friends grew up with me
 So I'll cross the skies and sail the seas
 To be where I wanna be
 
 'Cause there's no place I'd rather be"

 a gem upon the sea
 Where the future is an open book
 A land of destiny

 See the moon and the stars, look how far we have come
 Look around at our faces, they shine brightly in the sun
 With our hopes and dreams, imagine what tomorrow it may bring
 What do you see? What do you see?
 
 Now the time has come to reach out,
 To open up to see
 That we stand together in this land
 Cos we are family
 As thoughts of reaching to the sky are carried on a dream
 With hearts and minds united, our dreams we will achieve
 What do you see? What do you see?
 
 See the moon and the stars, look how far we have come
 Look around at our faces, they shine brightly in the sun
 With our hopes and dreams, imagine what tomorrow it may bring
 What do you see
 
 What do you see when life makes you take on a mountain
 Youll see that nothings gonna stand in your way
 Together we can share
 The strength of a million
 and the courage of a million more
 
 See the moon and the stars, look how far we have come
 Look around at our faces, they shine brightly in the sun
 With our hopes and dreams, imagine what tomorrow it may bring
 Cos the skys the only limit when youre not afraid to dream
 What do you see? What do you see..."

And in the end, hand in hand
We will get there

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Our home, our heart, our dream."
