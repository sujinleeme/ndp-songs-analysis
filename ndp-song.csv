 Reach out for your fellow man

 Recognise you can play your part
 Let it come right from your heart
 Be prepared to give a little more
 Stand up, stand up for Singapore
 
 Stand up for Singapore, do it with a smile
 If you stand up for Singapore
 You'll find it all worthwhile
 Believe in yourself, you've got something to share
 So show us all you really care
 Be prepared to give a little more
 Stand up, stand up for Singapore
 
 Singapore our home and nation
 Together with determination
 Join in like we've never done before

 Can't wait to see my sunny island
 In its glorious greenery, whether rain or shine, it's still beautiful
 Bright lights shine on the streets at night
 Guiding me closer to home
 To a place where I'll be safe and warm, where I belong
 
 Friends and families by my side
 Seeing me through as I grow and learn
 Every day's experience, bitter sweet or sour
 They're still wonderful
 As they become precious memories
 They'll be kept close to my heart
 And no matter where I am I will always know, where I belong
 
 Where I belong, where I keep my heart and soul
 Where dreams come true for us
 Where we walk together hand in hand towards a future so bright
 Where I belong, where I keep my heart and soul
 Where we're one big family

 That this is where I know I belong

 Remember the times, so fine, when we thought that
 Nothing could stand in our way?
 
 Then things weren't the same
 The life that we knew had to change
 We've struggled through, the darkest storms
 We thought we couldn't tame
 
 Together we've tried, as we stood side by side
 I knew we'd build a new world
 A world of hope for ever after
 
 Deep in my heart I just know
 Right from the start, we will grow
 Look where we are, we've come so far
 And there's still a long, long way to go
 
 With all of my heart, I will care
 I'll play my part, I will share
 With family and friends, together we'll stand
 And in the end, hand in hand
 We will get there
 
 So now we begin, working together to win
 Believing in trust, it must
 Be possible to overcome anything
 
 There's so much to do, there's so much we can contribute
 By sharing just a little love
 We will start again anew
 
 So why don't we try? If we stand side by side
 I know we'll build a new world
 A world of hope for ever after

 Home is where you’re not alone
 
 Pre-Chorus And our hearts will beat together Echoing what dreams may come Walking tall in any weather Time has come bang the drum Cause tomorrow's here today Chorus Dream away Take the world by the hand Cause tomorrow's here today Dream away Come let's go right away Cause tomorrow's here today Step into a brand new day Tomorrow's calling out your name When you know just who you are You can't stop you are on fire Looking up beyond the stars Fly the flag and raise it higher [Pre-Chorus] [Chorus] When we run along And we’re standing tall When we sing our song No way that we can fall Be what we want to be When we make our way Till it’s plain to see Tomorrow’s here today [Chorus]",
2017,Because it's Singapore,Lee Wei Song,Jay Lim,Jay Lim,,https://youtu.be/DI2TeyDJ7Zo,"Step by step
 Together we'll build our dreams
 Heart to heart
 Together we'll stay as one nation, undivided
 Back to back
 Together we'll brave the heat, the cold, the storms
 Hand in hand
 Together we'll grow this land that we call home
 
 Nothing in this world compares
 It's our Singaporean Life
 Everyone is family, friend and neighbour
 Living in harmony
 
 Nothing in this world compares
 To this island where it's home
 Where we love and know we'll never be alone
 Because it's Singapore (Just Believe)
 This is Singapore (We Can Be)
 Our Singapore (The world will see)
 We are Singapore

 “The future is uncertain and everything must change”
 Well all of my worries and all of my fears
 Begin to lose their weight, when I hold you near
 
 If all that we are is what we believe
 Then I know I’ve got to be the change I want to see
 How easy we forget that everything takes time
 No, nothing's ever perfect, but I still call you mine
 
 This is my country, this is my flag
 This is my future, this is my life
 This is my family, these are my friends
 We are Singapore, Singaporeans
 
 This is my country, this is my flag
 This is my future, this is my life
 This is my family, these are my friends
 We are Singapore, Singaporeans
 
 We, the citizens of Singapore,
 pledge ourselves as one united people,
 regardless of race, language or religion,
 to build a democratic society
 based on justice and equality
 so as to achieve happiness, prosperity
 and progress for our nation.
 
 This is my country, this is my flag
 This is my future, this is my life
 This is my family, these are my friends
 We are Singapore, Singaporeans
 
 We are Singapore, we are Singapore
 We will stand together, hear the lion roar
 We are Singapore, we are Singapore
 We’re a nation strong and free forever more
 (This is my country, this is my flag) We are Singapore, we are Singapore
 (This is my future, this is my life) We will stand together, hear the lion roar
 (This is my family, these are my friends) We are Singapore, we are Singapore
 We are Singapore, Singaporeans
 We are Singapore, Singaporeans",
